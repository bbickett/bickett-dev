This is my initial step into creating a personal site with hopefully some blog posts sharing what I've learning over my web development days.  This most likely includes making mistakes on this site to learn from and share as well.


Vue.js
Gridsome
BootstrapVue
Netlify


### Acknowledgement
I'm not a web designer but feel I at least have a good eye of what works or doesn't work.  I had a general idea of what I wanted my site to look like and had already decided to give Gridsome a chance.  In searching for existing sites using Gridsome, I stumbled upon [Dan Vega's site](https://github.com/danvega/danvega-dev) that looked very similiar to what I was going for.  So thanks to [Dan](https://www.danvega.dev/) for giving me a litle inspiration, and mostly guidance, on getting this setup quickly!
